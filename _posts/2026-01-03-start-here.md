Welcome to my research site focused on software supply chain security, threat intelligence, and detection engineering.

## What You'll Find Here

This site documents research on malicious packages, dependency attacks, and threat actor techniques targeting package ecosystems like npm, PyPI, and others. The focus is on reproducible analysis, detection rules, and security tooling.

## Key Topics

**Supply Chain Security:** Analysis of attacks targeting software dependencies and package registries. Research on malicious packages, typosquatting campaigns, and compromised maintainer accounts.

**Threat Intelligence:** Tracking threat actors, understanding their techniques, and documenting attack patterns. Focus on attribution indicators and behavioral analysis.

**Detection Engineering:** Building detection rules and security tools for identifying malicious packages. Development of reproducible research workflows and automation frameworks.

**Reverse Engineering:** Deep-dive analysis of malware found in package ecosystems. Documenting obfuscation techniques and payload delivery mechanisms.
