This site serves as a platform for sharing security research focused on software supply chain attacks, with emphasis on package ecosystems and dependency security.

## Research Approach

The research documented here follows principles of reproducibility and transparency. Analysis workflows are designed to be repeatable, with tooling and detection rules shared when appropriate.

**Focus Areas:**

- Malicious package discovery and analysis in npm, PyPI, and other registries
- Detection rule development for identifying suspicious packages
- Threat actor tracking and behavioral analysis
- Security tooling for automated dependency analysis

## Methodology

Analysis combines automated scanning with manual investigation. Tools are developed to scale detection efforts while maintaining accuracy. Each finding is documented with technical details and indicators of compromise.

**Key Principles:**

- Reproducible research workflows
- Open documentation of techniques
- Focus on detection and prevention
- Collaboration with security community

## Content Organization

Posts are organized by [categories](/categories/) and [tags](/tags/) for easy navigation. The [archives](/archives/) provide a chronological view of all published research.
